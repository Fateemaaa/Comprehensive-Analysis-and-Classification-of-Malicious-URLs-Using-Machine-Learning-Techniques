# Comprehensive-Analysis-and-Classification-of-Malicious-URLs-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
Information Security 

# Background.
The internet has evolved into a prominent platform for illicit activities, with URLs serving as the primary
conduit for online criminal endeavors. To address this issue, the security community has predominantly
concentrated on devising methods, primarily centered around blacklisting malicious URLs.
While effective in shielding users from recognized malicious domains, this strategy only addresses a
portion of the problem. Newly generated malicious URLs, proliferating across the web in abundance,
often gain an initial advantage in this ongoing security challenge.
The goal of this assignment is to perform comprehensive hands-on experience in working with datasets,
merging data, preprocessing, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), implementing machine
learning (ML) models, and critically analyzing the model results. The dataset focuses on classifying
malicious types from URLs into five categories.
Requirements:
# 1. Data Merging:
 Merge two datasets provided into a single dataset for analysis. Ensure proper handling
of key fields and address any missing or inconsistent data.
The dataset you require is composed of Multi-class classification problems (benign,
defacement, phishing, malware, spam), The major dataset can be found using the link
Main dataset, But this dataset contains only four classes, for the fifth class you have to
merge another dataset. You may use this dataset for getting 5 th class Helper Data .

# 2. Preprocessing:
 Handle missing values, if any, using suitable techniques.
 Perform data cleaning, including removing duplicates and outliers.
 Encode categorical variables appropriately for machine learning models.
# 3. Balancing the Dataset:
 Address class imbalance in the dataset to ensure fair representation of each malicious
type.

# 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 Conduct EDA to gain insights into the dataset.
 Generate descriptive statistics, visualize data distributions, and identify patterns.
 Explore relationships between features and the target variable.
# 5. Graphs and Plots:
 Create at least five meaningful graphs or plots that highlight insights obtained from the
dataset.
 Utilize appropriate visualization techniques to enhance data understanding.
# 6. Feature Extraction.
 There are features present in the URL, you can easily explore those features which help
the model to categorize URLs as benign/malicious, etc.

# 7. Machine Learning Models:
 Apply at least three machine learning classification models for predicting malicious
types from URLs.
 Ensure that the models achieve a minimum accuracy of 90%.
# 8. Results Visualization:
 Create visualizations showcasing the results of the ML models, such as confusion
matrices or ROC curves.
# 9. Critical Analysis Report (Max 3 Pages):
 Provide a concise report analyzing the performance of the applied ML models.
 Identify which model performed better and explain the reasons behind its success.
 Discuss any challenges faced during the analysis and propose potential improvements.
